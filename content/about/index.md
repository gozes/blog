## About Me

Hey, I'm Juan, but you can call me Gozes! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a software engineer with over six years of experience, primarily diving deep into the world of cloud computing and building robust, event-driven systems. My journey has also led me through the fascinating realm of data engineering, where I've wrangled big data using tools like DBT, SQL, and Spark. Day-to-day, you'll find me working with Go, Python, SQL, Docker, and Kubernetes – technologies I've grown to love (most of the time!).

Beyond the code, I'm a proud father to a wonderfully cute daughter who keeps life exciting and full of joy. I'm also navigating the world with an ADHD diagnosis, which brings its own unique set of challenges and perspectives to my work and life. When I'm not architecting systems or chasing after a toddler, I'm a huge anime enthusiast and a staunch supporter of Linux. My musical tastes lean towards the energetic beats of techno, though I definitely appreciate a good dose of metal too. I'm always curious and currently exploring the exciting landscapes of Zig, Elixir, and Rust. Oh, and did I mention I'm a bit of a self-hosting aficionado? My homelab is my playground for experimenting with all sorts of tech, especially Kubernetes!

## What You Might Find Here

This blog is a space for me to share my thoughts, experiences, and perhaps a few "aha!" moments. You can expect to find posts touching on my experiences as a software engineer, particularly through the lens of someone with ADHD – sharing strategies, challenges, and triumphs. I'll also be chronicling my adventures (and misadventures!) in running Kubernetes on my homelab for self-hosting various services.

Naturally, there will be plenty of content around Go, a language I use extensively and enjoy. We'll also delve into building and working with cloud-native systems, exploring best practices, new tools, and interesting patterns. While these are some core themes, I'm giving myself the freedom to explore any topic that piques my interest, so expect a diverse range of musings from tech deep-dives to perhaps even some thoughts on productivity or my latest anime binge!

## Let's Connect!

I'm always open to a good chat! If anything I've written resonates with you, if you have questions, or if you're interested in collaborating on something cool, please don't hesitate to reach out. I generally prefer asynchronous communication, as it helps me manage my focus and give thoughtful responses.
